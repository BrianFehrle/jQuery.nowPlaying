    <p>
     Ever since humans have been around, we've loved music. In diverse places like America, the music itself becomes as diverse as the people. Thus we have many artists, many albums, and inevitably <em>many flavors</em> of music. So this common bond we all have slowly breaks apart as each person finds their musical taste. We then narrow down our music to smaller and more specifc standards - and we get bored of it. What next? Our love for music isn't gone - it's just time for something new. Luckily, we live in a world full of computers that can pretty much do everything except grow grain! Now <a href="http://last.fm">Last.FM</a> joins the picture: they take the music you've loved and show you more of the diverse world of music around you - based on the music you're accustomed too. So what does this have to do with jQuery.nowPlaying? It's a script that makes it uber-easy to share <em>your</em> Last.fm musical taste (via our favorite JavaScript library - jQuery!) with the Guests on your website. Need a demo? Just look to your left, silly!

     <ol>
      <li>
       You're going to need a Last.fm API key to use jQuery.nowPlaying. It's easy to get one, just login to Last.fm and <a href="http://www.last.fm/api/account">head on over to the API page</a>, where you'll be given a key. You may also want some scrobbled music, so there is something to display!
      </li>
      <li>
       Place the `scripts`, `styles`, and `images` directories into your site structure. (If you want to use another directory structure, feel free to edit the source files)
      </li>
      <li>
       Include jQuery &amp; jQuery.nowPlaying in your page like so:
       <!-- Code nesting fail =P -->
       <pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/jQuery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/jQuery.nowPlaying.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
       Now, include the stylesheet:
       <pre>&lt;link type="text/css" href="css/lfm_style.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
       Make jQuery.nowPlaying a nice, cozy home:
       <pre>&lt;div class="nowPlaying"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
       Make it all happen:
       <pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br/> $(document).ready(function() {<br />  $(".nowPlaying").nowPlaying({<br />   apikey:'lastfm_apikey',<br />   username:'lastfm_username'<br />  });<br /> });<br />&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
       There are a few optional settings as well -
       <ul>
        <li>
         The `display` option allows you to choose the type of tracks to show. Here are the options:
         <pre>   display:'lovedTracks', // Show "loved" tracks</pre>
         <pre>   display:'topTracks', // Show "top" tracks</pre>
         <pre>   display:'recentTracks', // Show "recent" tracks. Default.</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
         The `number` option allows you to select the number of tracks shown. There is a maximum of 50 tracks:
         <pre>   number:20, // Show 20 tracks</pre>
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       Go listen to music. Lots and lots of music - duh, that's why you're here!
      </li>
     </ol>
