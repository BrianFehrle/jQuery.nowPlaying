 To keep the package light and development simple,
 visit http://code.kylehotchkiss.com/nowplaying for 
 examples and instructions. Also, send all your 
 feedback to hello@kylehotchkiss.com, as I do want 
 to make it as epic as possible =D. 

 As a disclaimer, jQuery.nowPlaying isn't as simple 
 as it could be, but nonetheless here is a quick 
 rundown on installation (remember the URL works too):

 1. Include jQuery and jQuery.nowPlaying in your page.
    
     <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
     <script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/jQuery.nowPlaying"></script>
     
 2. Initialize it.  

     <script type="text/javascript"> 
      $(document).ready(function() { 
       $(".nowplaying").nowPlaying({ 
        apiKey:'your-api-key', // You'll have to get it off Last.FM.
        username:'your-last.fm-username' 
       }); 
      }); 
     </script> 
     
     <div class="nowplaying"></div> <!-- Hint: It's gonna put some songs in that div --> 

 3. Have fun styling it! (Use the inspector to get the
    structure, if you need context to those div titles
    then head on over to the $.nowPlaying home page.)
   
 4. Enjoy your guests reactions to your inevitable love
 s   for Miley Cyrus and Brittney Spears.
